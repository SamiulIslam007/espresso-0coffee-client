# Espresso Coffee Frontend

This project is the frontend for the Espresso Coffee application. It provides a user interface to interact with the backend and display coffee-related information.

## Description

The Espresso Coffee Frontend is developed using:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces. React enables the creation of reusable UI components that make it easier to manage the user interface and its state.

- **React Router**: This library is used for handling routing within the application. It allows users to navigate between different views or pages without refreshing the browser, providing a seamless single-page application experience.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the application. Tailwind CSS provides a set of utility classes that help in creating custom designs directly in the markup.

- **DaisyUI**: A component library that integrates with Tailwind CSS. It provides pre-built UI components that are customizable and help speed up the development process.

The frontend communicates with an API provided by an Express backend. This backend is connected to a MongoDB database, which stores coffee-related data. The frontend application fetches this data from the API to display information about coffee items. This includes retrieving a list of all coffee items, viewing details of a specific coffee, and performing various operations based on user interactions.

By utilizing these technologies, the frontend delivers an interactive, visually appealing user experience, while effectively managing data and navigation.
